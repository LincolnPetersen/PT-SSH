# PT-SSH
simulation for PT-SSH analyses

This is the R code provided in "The neglected role of individual variation in the sexy son hypothesis", accepted in Evolutionary Ecology, as File S1. I use this code to show why individual variation in males' quality should be considered because, otherwise, the empirical validation of the hypothesis is hampered, giving rise to patterns that are apparently irreconcilable with the SSH predictions.
